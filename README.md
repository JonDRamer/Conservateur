### Description

###### I created this application for a local Austin artist who had a vision for a service that would connect aspiring art collectors and curators in a personal way.  The purpose of the app is to make is easy for anyone to find personalized art that meets their personal style and budget.

### Biggest Challenge

###### The biggest challenge for this project was also the most fun part of it. This is the first application that I ever built for someone else. I had to bring someone else's vision to life. The back and forth in meetings and multiple iterations on different functionality was both a challenge as well as an invaluable experience for me.
